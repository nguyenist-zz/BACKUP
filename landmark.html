				<h4>Product</h4>
				<p>Landmark is a mobile application for walking directions with step-by-step photos of geotagged landmarks.</p>
			</br>


				<h4>Problem</h4>
				<p>(1) Navigation Apps Are Made for Cars & Bikes: Though almost every smartphone user relies on navigation apps, most navigation applications are car-centric, rooted in maps and driving, not landmarks and walking.</p>
				<p>(2) Confusion & Time: It takes a few frustrating moments for your app to calibrate your new location. We often start walking and realize the blue dot on the map app is going in the wrong direction, and turn around, staring at our blue dot on a screen.</p>
				</p>(3) Preference for Landmarks: A large number of people prefer navigation via landmarks over maps. This entire market segment, which research suggests skews female, has to rely on mapping applications anyway.</p>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/work_landmark_9.png"> <div class="caption">Examples of current navigation apps we have today which all give users a very similar experience: a highlighted route, a blue dot and a birds-eye view map. The middle image shows transportation map guides which can often be confusing to understand.</div>

				<h4>Preliminary Interviews</h4>
				<p>We wanted to gather preliminary feedback and investigate how people navigated and what pain points they felt while navigating on foot. Fifty in-person interviews and hundreds of online surveys reveal a segment that intensely wants landmark-based directions. The following quotes are representative.</p>
				<p><em>“I’m a visual learner. I would love details on buildings, streets or landmarks I will pass on my route.”</em></p>
				<p><em>“I don’t know what 75 feet away vs. 0.3 miles is. I don’t have a gauge for how long that’s going to take. Those directions are confusing to me.”</em></p>
				<p><em>“It’s hard for me to read where I am on map on my smartphone since I have to zoom in so much. My blue dot is in the wrong spot so I end up walking the wrong way.”</em></p>
				<p><em>“I hate navigating because it’s frustrating trying to figure out which way to go on a sidewalk full of people. When it’s dark at night, I feel unsafe walking with my phone and map app out.”</em></p>
				<p><em>“All map apps look the same. Maps are also designed in a birds-eye view... but we aren’t birds.”</em></p>

				<h4 class="mt">Wireframing and paper prototyping.</h4>
					<p>We have focused on gathering helpful photos & designing UX that is more useful to some users than existing applications. We conducted a series of tests to understand what is the fastest way to gather photos of a city through Taskrabbits, Craigslist interns, photo taking in Lyft Cabs, gamification. Computer vision (CV) was the most efficient method. So, we developed a dashboard for data interns to manually select landmark photos from Foursquare across 10 cities. After categorizing thousands of photos with humans, we can use CV to sort more photos for us, much more quickly, at scale. 5 weeks and 80+ walking tests later, we have refined both our design and our method and are testing each week.</p>

				<h4 class="mt">Simulated walking usability studies</h4>
					<p class>Over several weeks, we went on simulated routes and tweaked the prototype daily, designing with user feedback and interactions from the previous day. We narrowed it down to 2 designs that users found intuitive and enjoyed. We conducted more simulated walking routes, timed them and determined which design allowed users to orient and navigate easily and effectively. In total, we have interviewed or walked with over 300 people to validate.</p>

				<h4 class="mt">Logo and branding process</h4>
				<p>Landmark is a new way of getting on point A to point B without relying on compasses and paper maps. We wanted the logo to reflect a cleaner, simpler way of navigating. While incorporating a famous landmark in the logo seemed intuitive at first, many users immediately thought the app involved adventure and tourism in a new city instead of an alternative way of getting your everyday directions. After dozens of iterations, we decided to go with a fresh blue and red toned compass needle with fresh, modern typography. It emulated the simplicity of Landmark.</p>
