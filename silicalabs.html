				<p>Silica Labs Software Corp, our Washington, D.C. based startup is recognized as a global leader in software development, particularly for mobile and wearable software. Together since April 2013, we have created software for some of  the most innovative companies in the world, including Mapbox, SingTel, Social Radar, Surescripts. We also created a proprietary platform used by media brands, including National Geographic, and the Atlantic, to distribute their content through mobile and wearable devices. These companies are very different, ranging from a social-location startup to a 100 year- old nonprofit, a billion-dollar software company to a telecommunications giant larger than AT&T. Moreover, each software application met different technical and business objectives.</p>

				<p>Automattic is almost synonymous with its flagship product, WordPress.com. WordPress.com powers 33 million blogs and the news sites of  organizations such as CNN and Time. Collectively, the network is the seventh most popular site on the Internet.A few months after Google Glass was made available to 2,000 “Explorers,” Tumblr, Twitter, and Facebook released sharing-apps for Google Glass.Since there was no app for WordPress.com, we created one and tested it in Iceland. That blog created using this application was featured on WordPress’s front page, Freshly Pressed and resulted in a profile in <a href="https://pando.com/2013/08/02/google-glass-for-publishers-silica-labs-makes-it-as-easy-as-an-rss-tap/">Pando Daily</a>.</p>
				</p>Paul Sieminski, General Counsel of Automattic: “We have a great community of  developers creating amazing WordPress plugins. But the folks at Silica Labs not only created new technical functionality, they also used it to share a personal story about a trip through the glaciers and geothermal swamps of Iceland. It caught our attention, considering our company’s mission of  democratizing publishing.”</p>

					National Geographic is a nonprofit headquartered in Washington, DC and founded in 1888. In 2013 it sought (1) an app on Google Glass with a feature set matching those of the first released media apps by New York Times, CNN, and Elle. It later sought a software integration (2) to send photos directly from a Glass device to the company’s photo blog, so that National Geographic photographers in the field could directly share first hand photos from the device with all of the photo blog’s readers. We worked with them to design and build both applications. We had to integrate with their content databases both to access and input images, text, and video. It enabled any media company to create an app and send media content to Google Glass using a simple dashboard and without writing a line of code. This software was featured in <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3020736/most-creative-people/wear-your-news-this-platform-turns-any-rss-feed-into-a-google-glass-app">Fast Company</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/12/09/wearably/">Mashable</a>.</p>

					Mapbox is one of the biggest providers of custom online maps for major websites such as Four-square, Pinterest, Evernote, the Financial Times and Uber Technologies. We worked with the development team to build Mapbox’s Android SDK for Android Wear. We prepared instructions on how to build an Android Wear app using Mapbox's SDK and designed and built a demo app Mapbox SDK and custom offline maps. This concepts shows the possibility of building beautiful, offline maps to smartwatches such as the Moto360, Samsung Galaxy Gear and the Samsung Smartwatch.

					<p> The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is an luxury resort facing the Marina Bay in Singapore. Developed by Las Vegas Sands, it is billed as the world's most expensive standalone casino property at $8 billion, including cost of the prime land. This application would enable Google Glass Explorers to take a tour uncovering Singapore’s most notable landmarks and record/share their breathtaking rooftop experience through photos and video. We prototyped the app to include a minute long tour where visitors can find audiovisual content of selected landmarks of Singapore, as well as take photo and video of their tour. The Glassware is location-aware and offered content based on the user location within the observation deck.

					<p>HungryGoWhere is a food and restaurant review website used in countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia and Australia. The app is used to gather information on food establishments and a portal where these businesses can grow their online profile. HungryGoWhere was developed in 2004 and was acquired in 2012 by Singapore Telecommunications Limited. SingTel reached out to us to build an interactive experience with HungryGoWhere through Google Glass. For this project, we: 
					<ul class="text-left">
						<li>Architected content hierarchy, design, structure and navigation to fit these objectives.</li>
						<li>Designed a visual aesthetic that is informative, intuitive and interesting – allowing the content to be easily accessible and usable on Glass following UI best practices for wearable devices.</li>
						<li>Built the software using accepted standards and relying on the Mirror API and, as relevant, the Glass Developer Kit, with a highly robust, flexible and scalable cloud service to ensure reliability and ease of updates/maintenance.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Winson Wong, Innovation and Partnerships at SingTel LifeLabs, San Francisco: “Silica Labs has been extremely professional, creative, and responsive to us to date. Throughout the initial conceptual and design phases of  work, they have been focused on creating a great user experience with plenty of  new ideas and original ways to delight the end users.”</p>

					Social Radar is a startup that merges identity and location, enabling people to know when friends are nearby. Its CEO, Michael Chasen, previously was CEO and founder of  Blackboard, the education company he recently sold for $1.7 billion. Social Radar hired us to help their team architect their product on wearable devices, mainly Google Glass. We worked closely with their team to design and develop a Glass app that displays nearby friends, identifies rele-vant people in the room based on location and identify, and activates a “radar” enabling the user to follow an arrow displayed in Glass towards the nearby friend. We integrated with their databases and backend technology regarding users’ identities, location, privacy preferences, and interests.</p>
					<p>Michael Chasen: “We scoured the East Coast looking for the best Google Glass development team we could get. The team at Silica Labs was totally ahead of the game and clearly the team to pick. They did great work for us, were responsive and professional, and just a pleasure to work with.”</p>

				<p>Surescripts is the nation’s largest e-prescription network, connecting prescribers in all 50 states through their choice of software to payers, chain pharmacies, and independent pharmacies.We designed and built a custom application as part of Surescript’s promotional and marketing efforts aimed at Congressmen and their staff at an all- day event on Capitol Hill. The Glass application helped Surescripts stick out from the crowd and portray their brand as innovative and forward- thinking to the legislators they often work with.</p>
